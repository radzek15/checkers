  <h1 align="center">Checkers</h1>
  <p align="justify">The Checkers Game is an interactive and engaging Python project built using the Pygame library. 
                    It offers two exciting gameplay modes - Player vs Player (PvP) and Player vs CPU. In the latter mode, 
                    the CPU is implemented using the powerful minimax algorithm, providing players with a challenging and competitive experience.</p></div>

| Player vs Player Mode    | <p align="justify">This mode allows two human players to engage in a classic Checkers match on the same device. Each player takes turns moving their pieces across the board to capture their opponent's pieces and claim victory.</p>                                                                       |
| Player vs CPU Mode       | <p align="justify">In this mode, players can test their skills against an intelligent CPU opponent. The CPU utilizes the minimax algorithm to make strategic moves and provide an exciting challenge for players. Users can play only simple difficulty level of the CPU, yet it can become challenging.</p> |
| Interactive GUI          | <p align="justify">The game's user interface is designed with Pygame, offering an interactive and visually appealing board layout. Players can easily interact with the game using mouse drag&drop to select and move their pieces across the board.</p>                                                     |
| Highlighting Valid Moves | <p align="justify">The game provides users with a useful feature to highlight valid moves for each selected piece. This feature helps players to make informed decisions and strategize their moves effectively.</p>                                                                                         |
| Visual Feedback          | <p align="justify">Players receive visual feedback for each player turn and winning the game. This enhances the overall gaming experience and adds excitement to each move.</p>                                                                                                                              |

### Usage:
</p>

  * Firstly clone the repo with this command:
    * `git clone https://github.com/radzek15/checkers`
  * Create virtual environment and install dependencies:
    * `cd checkers`
    * `python -m venv venv`
    * Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`, Linux/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
    * `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  * Eventually run tests:
    * Tests will be available soon using pytest.
  * To start the Checkers Game, simply run the 'game.py' script from the command line with the desired mode:
    * `python game.py [OPTION]`
      * `cpu`: In this mode, the player competes against the CPU, which employs the minimax algorithm to make strategic decisions.
      * `pvp`: In this mode, two players can take turns playing against each other on the same device.

In the future, I plan to expand this Checkers game to be challenging for more experienced players, providing them with challenging levels that test their skills, by implementing more advanced algorithms to make calculated moves and offer a greater challenge.

Ultimately, my goal is to create a comprehensive and enjoyable Checkers game that appeals to players of all levels, from novices to seasoned experts. With each update, I look forward to delivering new features and improvements that keep the game fresh and exciting for everyone.
